## Overview

Information about different data types IFR uses and how i can convert them to be more unified
aka quaternions max at 255 but vectors dont? or vice versa, thats what this is figuring out

TODO: figure otu limits for these: how big each one is and if it can be compressed further

## Data Types

1. **Vector**  
   - Comes out of the ship vectors
   - ??

2. **Position**  
   - Comes from ship vector and beam ouput(?)
   - need to figure out positions of the ship dock ect, getting vector to them is too hard (only frm cockpit) so figurting them out before hand and using ship position for vector is more efficient

3. **Rotation**  
   - from ship orientation. might be vectors?

4. **Regular Value**  
   - 0-65535
   - can be made to be -32.. - 32 if wanted?
