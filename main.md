The Control Unit project explores an alternate type of CPU that doesn't deal in traditional operations like addition or subtraction. Instead, it uses instructions such as:

- `face xyz`
- `thrust main`
- `loop`
- `dampen on`

This approach focuses on vector-based operations and unique instruction sets tailored for specific tasks.
